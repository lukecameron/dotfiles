# my dotfiles

# setup

- install GNU Stow (`brew install stow` / `apt-get install stow`)
- Clone into a directory under in home (I use `~/dotfiles`)
- `cd dotfiles`
- `stow <app name>` for any apps you want to configure

`stow` creates symlinks in the parent directory from where you call it by default.
